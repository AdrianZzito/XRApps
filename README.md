## Welcome to Join Us

The release of Apple Vision Pro heralds the advent of the spatial computing era, prompting tech enthusiasts and developers to contemplate how to create unique three-dimensional applications on new interactions, systems, and hardware.

Since the WWDC 2023 keynote, social media has been flooded with beautiful mockups and demo videos of visionOS Apps. However, it's challenging to try other developers' creations because the Apple Vision Pro hasn't been officially released yet.

To address this issue, we developed the Let's visionOS App. Through it, you can try out visionOS Apps created by other community members and get an early taste of the allure of spatial computing devices.

We hope this tool will foster more frequent communication among developers and promote the growth of the entire community.

Let's visionOS is a platform for exchanging visionOS applications, allowing you to distribute your developed visionOS apps to enthusiasts worldwide.

This repository is the application index repository for Let's visionOS. If you wish to **publish, distribute, or update** an existing app on Let's visionOS, you need to submit the relevant metadata files in this repository.

> Please note that you do not need to upload the application body to this repository. In addition, Let's visionOS does not require you to open source your app; you only need to upload the basic metadata to start distributing your app.

## Publishing Your Product on GitHub

- Run your project to locate the binary file of your current application under the visionOS simulator, compress it into a ZIP file named `app.zip`, and ensure the package name is unchanged to avoid indexing errors.

</div>


- Create a repository for the current app on GitHub (if you've already done so, skip this step). Ensure the repository is of `Public` type, as private ones will fail the app information retrieval.

</div>

- Navigate to the `Release` page of the repository, select the tag to be released, and upload the `app.zip` package prepared earlier, filling in the corresponding Release version name (recommended to keep it the same as the tag number).

## Submitting Your App Information to XReality.Zone's Source

- Fork the [XRApps repository](https://github.com/XRealityZone/XRApps) at XReality.Zone.

<div align="center">

</div>

- Clone the forked repository locally and create a new branch, naming it `app/Your_Appâ€™s_Bundle_ID`.

<div align="center">

</div>

- Each app to be published on the platform needs to have a folder in `XRApps` containing relevant files. To avoid folder name duplication, it is recommended to name the folder with a unique identifier, such as the Bundle ID. Here's the basic folder structure:

```plaintext
Folder
  - meta.json 
  - info.json
  - icon.png
  - some_photo.png
```

- `meta.json` stores the basic metadata of the app, mainly used for identification and retrieval. Here's an example file:

```plaintext
{
    "id": "579271a6-b86a-4dae-bbed-f856e830b42d",
    "name": "HelloWorld",
    "icon": "icon.png",
