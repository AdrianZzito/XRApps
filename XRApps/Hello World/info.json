    "description": "You can use visionOS scene types and styles to share information in fun and compelling ways. Features like volumes and immersive spaces let you put interactive virtual objects into people’s environments, or put people into a virtual environment.\nHello World uses these tools to teach people about the Earth — the planet we call home. The app shows how the Earth’s tilt creates the seasons, how objects move as they orbit the Earth, and how Earth appears from space.\nThe app uses SwiftUI to define its interface, including both 2D and 3D elements. To create, customize, and manage 3D models and effects, it also relies on the RealityKit framework and Reality Composer Pro.",
